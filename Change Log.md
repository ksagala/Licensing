Note that there is functionality that only resides in the suite SKUs and not inside the individual Office 365, EMS, or Windows 10 SKUs. These are known as "suite only" features. Customers that previously bought Microsoft 365 E5 licenses may need a zero-cost add-on to get suite only features.

* Added "Office 365 Cloud App Security" to Office 365 E5 plans. There was some confusion because this was retired as a stand-alone SKU (I.E. you cannot buy it on its own, only as part of Office 365 E5), but I've confirmed it is still part of Office 365 E5.

"Microsoft Defender ATP" does not use the Windows naming because it grants benefits for usage on 3rd party operating systems (i.e. Mac OS).
* Replaced "Windows Defender Antivirus" link, previous link now redirects to generic Windows page.
* Added "Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP)" to rights not included in "Windows 10 E3 for Microsoft 365 F1", as per Microsoft Product Terms, January 2020.
